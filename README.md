#### Summary / Context

These are the design files for a Pick & Place Magnetic Nozzle intended to be used with the <a href="https://github.com/firepick1/FPD-LooseCanon/blob/dev/mechanical/3DLCxxxx%20-%20LooseCanon%20parts/STL/3DLC1005%20Nema8%20Tool%20Mount%20%28plated%29.stl"> 3DLC1005 Nema8 Tool Mount </a>(Thanks Karl) on the <a href="https://github.com/firepick-delta/firepick-delta"> FirePick Delta</a>. 
The Magnetic holder idea came after watching  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYfD0UUKyek"> this video</a>.
A magnet on the extender so that the nozzles can be automaticly changed. Also it has to be made from metal (machined) so it has an air tight seal and doesnt wear to quick.
